>> Autowiring 
> Injecting FortuneService into a Coach implementation
> Spring will scan @Component
> Any one implements FortuneService interface???
> What if we have multiple FortuneService implementation 
> If so, let's inject them ... however which one?

>> Solution: Be specific! - @Qualifier

@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
    
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("happyFortuneService")
    private FortuneService fortuneService;

}

>> Injection Types:
> Can apply @Qualifier annotation to 
    > Constructor injection 
    > Setter injection methods 
    > Field injection
